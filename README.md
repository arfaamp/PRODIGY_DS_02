Task 2 - Data Science Internship | Prodigy Info Tech
This repository contains my second task for the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Info Tech. I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns.

## Files:
`titanic_Dataset& Visualization.xlsx `→ Contains both the cleaned dataset and visualization.
`titanic_dataset.csv` → Processed dataset (tables only) for easy access.
`visuals.png` → Screenshot of the analysis results.

## Description:
- Cleaned the Titanic dataset to remove missing values and inconsistencies.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns.
- Created visualizations to understand the relationships between variables.
